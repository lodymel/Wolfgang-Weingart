# Wolfgang Weingart

**Pure Coding Project** | Framework-Free | Vanilla JavaScript

A pure coding website dedicated to Wolfgang Weingart, the father of New Wave Typography. This project showcases his life and work through a framework-free, vanilla web experience built entirely from scratch.

## 🎨 About This Project

This is a **pure coding** portfolio website—built entirely from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—no frameworks, no libraries, no dependencies. Just pure, handcrafted code.

- **PC-Optimized Design**: Desktop-first experience
